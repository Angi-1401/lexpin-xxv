/**
 * JSDoc Comments for JavaScript Files
 * 
 * JSDoc is a markup language used to annotate JavaScript code. It allows developers
 * to add documentation directly within the code, making it easier to understand and
 * maintain. JSDoc comments are typically placed above functions, classes, methods,
 * and other code structures.
 * 
 * Inside the comment block, various tags can be used
 * to provide specific information about the code.
